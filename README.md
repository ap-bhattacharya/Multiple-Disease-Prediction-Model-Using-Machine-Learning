# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on input data. This project leverages trusted datasets to train and test the model, offering a cost-effective and time-saving solution compared to traditional doctor visits.

## Features
- **Predicts Multiple Diseases:** The model is capable of predicting multiple diseases based on the provided input data.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Cost and Time Efficient:** Aims to reduce the need for frequent doctor visits by providing initial predictions based on user input.
- **Trusted Dataset:** The model is trained on a trusted and verified dataset, ensuring reliability and accuracy.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Dataset Preparation:** Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and placed in the `dataset/` directory.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - To train the model, run the training script (if available) or the corresponding Jupyter notebook in the `colab files/` directory.
   
3. **Prediction:**
   - To make predictions, use the script in the `models/` directory or run the application file `app.py` (if applicable).

## Example
Here’s an example of how to run predictions after setting up the environment:
```bash
python src/predict.py --input_data sample_input.csv
```
